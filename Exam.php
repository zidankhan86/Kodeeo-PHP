<!-- 
Create a PHP class called Car that has three private properties: Smake, $Smodel, and $year. Define a constructor
5) Ostad < method to set the values of these properties when a new object is created. Also, define six additional methods:
get_make(), get_model(), get_year(), set_make(), set_model(), and set_year(). The get_ methods should allow us to
retrieve the values of the private properties, while the set_ methods should allow us to update them. Finally, define
a method called display_info() that echoes out the car's make, model, and year.
